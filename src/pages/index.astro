      > in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, on track to complete a Bachelor of Applied
      Science Degree in April of 2024. In my free time, I enjoy doing physical activity
      such as playing basketball, soccer, swimming, as well as gaming. I also enjoy
      programming in my past time, working on side-projects and applications that
      have different purposes. Currently I am seeking <strong
        >permanent, full time new graduate roles</strong

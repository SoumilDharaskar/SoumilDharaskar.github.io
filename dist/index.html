              A cross-platform mobile application that allows organizers of real

              I worked in a team to develop a digital Battlesnake in the form of
              a web server, which implemented an API for a virtual game
            </li>
            <li>
              In the game, our designed snake maneuvered an 11x11 square grid to
              collect food and force other snakes to collide into its body,
              while avoiding the bodies of other snakes to win. The game client
              executed a simulation with many snakes on a game board, which
              continued until only one snake was remaining on the board. A
              sample simulation is shown on the right
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to play, the game client sent HTTP requests to our web
              server, including information about the state of the game board,
              such as the health and location of our snake on the board, as well
              as the location of food and other snakes. This data was used to
              implement logic that would determine the best possible move based
              on the current game state
